What this is
-------------
  
I recently found RethinkDB and was amazed at how easy everything seemed to be,
however one thing that I've missed is how the data is just a Python `List` or
`Dict` rather than a full wrapper class. So I figured a good way to learn the
general use of the Python RethinkDB driver was to write a general wrapper class
that functioned a bit like an ORM, providing some easier to work with data and
objects.  
  
Warnings
---------
Well, first off: I'm only a second year university student, and software isn't
even my major; I'm working towards an Electrical and Computer Engineering
degree, so not only will I have limited time to keep this maintained, but I
also probably won't write the best code ever. Secondly, this takes some
influence from the [Python Django ORM](https://github.com/dparlevliet/rwrapper)
and other ORM systems, however I haven't really followed a standard pattern for
the interface for this module. If someone wants to make this more standardized
feel free to, and just submit a pull request, I'll look it over and probably
will give it the go ahead.  
  
Docs
----
TODO: Write these. In the mean time, read the source, I've tried to do a
mediocre job of writing some doc strings for everything.  
  
Testing
-------
TODO: Write tests!  
  
Contributing
------------
Submit a pull request or open an issue. Most things I probably won't have time
to get around to looking at too deeply, so if you want it fixed, a pull request
is the way to go.  
Besides that, I'm releasing this under the GPLv3 License as found in the
`LICENSE.txt` file. Enjoy!
