This has the potential to break some backwards compatibility with v0.2.0 and below
1. Several names have changed, primarily: protectedItems is now protected_items, primaryKey is now primary_key, orderBy in collections is now order_by. There are probably others that I'm missing however.
2. The ability to join tables or models within a collection have been removed for now.
3. The find classmethod on models has been removed.
4. fromRawEntry is not outdated, and can be replaced by just instantiating a new model with the data.
5. The models no longer keep track of if a document is new and just use the RethinkDB drivers upsert ability to insert or update a document.
6. Passing a key and data will now no longer raise an exception, but instead return a new model.
7. Providing only id as a keyword argument to the model will cause it to assume the document is in the database, and it will attempt to get that document.
8. Most documentation has been updated for these changes however there are still several undoc'd or poorly doc'd functions hanging out in the code. See: http://rethinkorm.readthedocs.org/en/dev/ for more information.
9. Like the documentation, there are a few functionality items that are missing tests.
